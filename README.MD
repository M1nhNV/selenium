## Design pattern used

* Factory Pattern (to instantiate a webdriver)
* Page Object Model Pattern (this one is self-explainatory)
* DTO (to store test data from a Json file, web service)
* Singleton (if you can avoid it, the better)
* Adapter (to convert an object to a compatible format from other system)
